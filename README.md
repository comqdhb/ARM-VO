# ARM-VO

**Authors**: [Zana Zakaryaie Nejad](http://imrid.net/) and [Ali Hosseininaveh](https://wp.kntu.ac.ir/hosseininaveh/Hosseininaveh_CV.html) 

ARM-VO is an efficient monocular visual odometry algorithm designed for ARM processors. It uses NEON C intrinsics and multi-threading to accelerate keypoint detection and tracking. Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RwymYYxd5s&t=) to see the performance on Raspberry Pi 3 and Odroid XU4.

## Dependencies
- Cmake
- OpenCV ([built with TBB](http://imrid.net/?p=3917))
- ROS (Optional)

## How to build?
```
git clone https://github.com/zanazakaryaie/ARM-VO.git
cd ARM-VO
cmake .
make
```
## Test on KITTI dataset
Download the odometry dataset from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php).
Open a terminal and type:
```
./ARM_VO pathToData paramsFileName
```

NB pathToData needs a / at the end e.g.
```
./ARM_VO 00/image_2/ params/Seq00-02.yaml
```
## ROS (Optional)
The ros node subscribes to "kitti/image" topic and publishes "arm_vo/pose" which is of type geometry_msg::Pose. To use the ROS node:
Open a terminal and type:
```
cd ROS
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun ARM_VO ARM_VO paramsFileName
```
Now, open another terminal and type:
```
cd ROS
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun ARM_VO ImagePublisher pathToData
```

## Limitations
- ARM-VO recovers the scale if the camera height and pitch angle are provided. Thus, it is not applicable for drones or hand-held cameras.

- The algorithm detects small-inter frame translations and pure rotations using GRIC but it doesn't decompose the estimated homography matrix. Track is lost if the camera rotates too much without translation. 

## Notes
- If you get low FPS, check your power adapter. Raspberry Pi 3 runs ARM-VO at 8 frames per second (averagelly) if powered up with a 5V-2A adapter.
